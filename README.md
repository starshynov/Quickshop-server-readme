##Release 1

**QuickShop** is an online art store (first release: paintings only) that combines a traditional catalog with upcoming “intelligent” search by image content, mood, and color palette.

## Idea
- Online store with vector search: developed basic functionality for an online store and am integrating Qdrant to search for products by visual and emotional features in order to improve the quality of search and transform the user experience.

## Key Features

- **Product Catalog**  
  Intuitive browsing of paintings with a responsive, masonry-style feed.  
- **Category Search**  
  Filter by painting style (Renaissance, Impressionism, Contemporary, etc.).  
- **Intelligent Search** *(release 2,next)*  
  Semantic search by what’s depicted, emotional impact, and dominant color palette—powered by Qdrant vector embeddings.  
- **Ordering & Delivery**  
  Place orders and arrange deliveries within the Netherlands (release 1–release 2).
